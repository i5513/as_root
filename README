as_root is a perl script which help you if in your departament don't want to
use sudo.

It basically use expect to automatically login as root in server though ssh:

ssh machine "su -"
password: xxxx
# 

In this moment as_root recognize only xml keepass v1 format. xml example in
this source is from keepass v2, in my next commit I will make it compatible.

I'm playing with git, so I expect to have errors ...

Well, to be improved !
