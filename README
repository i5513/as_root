as_root is a perl script which help you if in your departament don't want to
use sudo.

It basically use expect to automatically login as root in server though ssh:

ssh machine "su -"
password: xxxx
# 

You need a password file exported to xml from keepass v2. Actually you need
encrypt it:

openssl des3 -salt -e -in passwords.xml -out passwords-encrypted.xml

or configuring -d (decrypt option) when using as_root.

as_root will read in this order:

-c file_config
~/.as_root/config
/etc/as_root/config

Directives supported are:

log_file
user
decrypt
passwords_file
default_password

I'm playing with git, so I expect to have errors ...

Well, to be improved !
